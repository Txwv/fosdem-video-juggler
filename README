This repository contains the still evolving tool for the FOSDEM VIDEO hardware.

Current working setup:
----------------------

The TFP401 is pretty finicky about what modes it does accept correctly. We
need to provide some small hacks to have our test/validation setup work
correctly.

These issues should go away when we move to the ADV7611.

Output side:
------------

On the outputting allwinner device, run:

./test_output <frame_count> 74.5  1280 1390 1430 1652  720 725 730 752  +hsync +vsync

This is an adjusted modeline to make the tfp401 module happy.

Alternatively, run make in Documentation/EDID/ in the kernel tree, and copy
the 1280x720_tfp401.bin to /lib/firmware/edid/, and add the following to
u-boot commandline:
 drm.edid_firmware=edid/1280x720_tfp401.bin

That will automatically make the hdmi block select the right timing upon boot.

Capture side:
-------------

On the capture device, run:

./juggler <frame_count> 216 22

This will set up the delays after h/vsync to make the tfp401 module provide a
correct image.

These settings have now been added as defaults in the CSI1 driver.
